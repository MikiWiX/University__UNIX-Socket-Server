# UNIX Socket Server
### University task
##### ASCII C, Socket
#### Running
*makefile* (in case you - the reader don't know how it works: type 'make' in terminal while in project directory and the magic will happen)
#### Description
Basic implementation of a parallel, yet single-threaded socket sever, connected to chat.c, which is basically usage example file.
Not much to talk about other than educational purposes.
#### Side Notes
The code hasn't been properly tested for bugs, and it does not follow any particular standard (effectively making it useless without modification).  
'arrays' folder contains special array based Structure implementation and functions used. Those were also created by me.
